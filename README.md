# Justin Second Project

Still deciding on what I would like it to be. I am debating between a meal planning app or clothing closet

### Description

- Clothing APP

Thinking through this the app would be a site where you can search a database of clothes. You will also be able to go to a page to build a closet. Here you will be able to add clothing to your closet, remove clothing and edit clothing.

You will also be able to navigate to a section that will allow you to select clothing and build an outfit.

- Meal Planning App

  In this app you will be able to search a database of food. You will be able to build out a weekly meal plan from the food you search. If something does not exist you will be able to add it. You can also remove items from the plan meal day.
