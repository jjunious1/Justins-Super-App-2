# Justin Second Project

Still deciding on what I would like it to be. I am debating between a meal planning app or clothing closet

### Description

- Meal Planning App
  ![Meal-Plan](https://jordosworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/meal-plan-2-1-791x1024.jpg 'Text to show on mouseover')
  In this app you will be able to search a database of food. You will be able to build out a weekly meal plan from the food you search. If something does not exist you will be able to add it. You can also remove items from the planned meal day.
